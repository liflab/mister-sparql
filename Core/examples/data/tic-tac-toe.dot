# Starting graph for the tic-tac-toe example.
#
# This graph represents the game board as a 3x3 grid. Each cell of the grid is
# represented by a node. The edges between nodes represents the adjacency of
# the cells in the grid. The edges are labeled with the direction of the
# adjacency: R for right, D for down, RD for right-down and LD for left-down.
#
# 1 -R> 2 -R> 3
# |\    |   / |
# D RD  D LD  D
# v   \ v/    v
# 4 -R> 5 -R> 6
# |   / |\    |
# D LD  D RD  D
# v/    v   \ v
# 7 -R> 8 -R> 9
#
# The label for each node is the empty string, representing an empty cell.
